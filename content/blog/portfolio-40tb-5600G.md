**"Storage without structure is chaos."** This customer knew that all too well. Their aging Windows 7 Home server, running on three separate 4TB drives, was bursting at the seams—not just with data, but with inefficiencies. It was time for a change. They wanted a server that wasn’t just an upgrade but a leap forward.

The result? A TrueNAS powerhouse. Built with **48GB of DDR4 RAM**, powered by an **AMD 5600G**, and equipped with a massive **40TB of new storage** in a RAID-Z1 configuration. We didn’t stop there. Their existing drives? Repurposed into an additional RAID-Z1 group, ensuring no storage went to waste.

This isn’t just a new server; it’s a **future-proofed data fortress** designed for performance and efficiency. We even fine-tuned the BIOS to shut off desktop-centric features, saving power without sacrificing speed.

## **The Build Process**

### 1. **Migrating the Existing Data**  
We started by transferring all the data from the old 3x4TB drives into the newly built 4x10TB RAID-Z1 array. This ensured no risk of data loss during the rebuild process.  

*Migration tools used:*  
- TrueNAS replication tasks  
- Manual integrity checks post-transfer  

> **Tip:** Always verify data integrity when moving large datasets, especially when transitioning to a new storage structure.

### 2. **Repurposing the Old Drives**  
Once the data was safe in the new array, we repurposed the customer's original 3x4TB drives. We added an additional 4TB drive to create a second RAID-Z1 group, maximizing storage redundancy and reusability.  

### 3. **Fine-Tuning the System**  
To squeeze out every ounce of performance, we:  
- Disabled unnecessary desktop features in BIOS.  
- Enabled ECC-like RAM settings for added data reliability.  
- Configured TrueNAS pools with optimized block sizes for their use case.

## **Performance Metrics**  
After deployment, we ran performance tests to ensure the system was hitting its benchmarks.  

| **Metric**        | **Result**                        |  
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| Sequential Write  | XXX MB/s                          |  
| Sequential Read   | XXX MB/s                          |  
| Power Usage       | ~40W idle, ~100W under full load  |
